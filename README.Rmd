# didhetero: Treatment Effect Heterogeneity in Staggered Difference-in-Differences

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The **didhetero** package provides tools to construct doubly robust 
uniform confidence bands (UCB) for the group-time conditional average treatment 
effect (CATT) function given a pre-treatment covariate of interest 
in the staggered difference-in-differences setup of Callaway and Sant'Anna (2021).
The uniform inference procedures are developed by [Imai, Qin, and Yanagi (2023) "Doubly Robust Uniform Confidence Bands for Group-Time Conditional Average Treatment Effects in Difference-in-Differences"](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2305.02185).

## Installation

Get the package from GitHub:

```{r, eval = F, echo = T}
# install.packages("devtools") # if needed
devtools::install_github("tkhdyanagi/didhetero", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

## Vignette

For more details, see the package vignette with:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Getting Started with the didhetero Package
vignette("didhetero")
```
