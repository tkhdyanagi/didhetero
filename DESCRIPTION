Description: Understanding the heterogeneity in treatment effects with repect to
    groups, periods, and covariates is essential in empirical analysis 
    using the staggered difference-in-differences (DiD) methods.
    This package provides tools to construct doubly robust uniform confidence bands 
    for the group-time conditional average treatment effect (CATT) function
    given a continuous pre-treatment of covariate and a variety of useful 
    summary parameters in the staggered DiD setup 
    of Callaway and Sant'Anna (2021).
    The uniform inference procedures are developed by 
    Imai, Qin, and Yanagi (2025) <doi:10.48550/arXiv.2305.02185>.
